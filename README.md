# CafeHunting

## Overview
The objective of the website is to establish a platform that generates suitable cafa data outcomes using a filter. Initially, we focus on integrating the front-end with the back-end. The front-end will relay user-selected commands from the filter to the back-end. In response, the back-end will interact with a specifically required database and transmit the results back to the front-end.

## Front-end


## Back-end
The Taipei Cafe API is accessible at [https://cafenomad.tw/api/v1.2/cafes/taipei/]. This API generates a file known as (Cafe.sql)[/back end/database/Cafe.sql/], which is then converted into a .json format. This conversion results in the creation of a database named (cafedata.json)[/back end/database/cafedata.json/].
