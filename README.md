# CafeHunting

## Overview
The objective of the website is to establish a platform that generates suitable cafa data outcomes using a filter. Initially, we focus on integrating the front-end with the back-end. The front-end will relay user-selected commands from the filter to the back-end. In response, the back-end will interact with a specifically required database and transmit the results back to the front-end.
